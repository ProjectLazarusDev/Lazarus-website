Earth-Prime has reached it's peak. We've mined out whatever fossil fuel this planet has to offer, done all the work for it and yet we were still unable to provide. We were sure that we had enough to go around, yet we were wrong. \
\
Nonetheless, we do what we do best. **Survive**. \
\
With my team, we have recently discovered the magic from a 2022 expedition to the Moon, dubbed the _Moon-Core_. We were able to harness its power and seemingly power our technology thru it.\
\
Knowing how scarce _Moon-Core_ is, we have channelled most, if not all, into the our proprietary systems \<BOBOTS.EXE>. Sending out willing participants into void, harnessing their minds into our \<BOBOTS>, bringing it back to us and doing God's work. I wish them the best in bringing back Humanity's prowess.\
\
Godspeed. \
