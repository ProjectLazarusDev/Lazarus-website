# ðŸš§ Arbitrum

## L1 Project Origin

Bobots is originally designed as an NFT Collection in the Ethereum L1 Blockchain. After seeing the potential in low cost gas fees. It is decided to expand the gameplay aspects of original game and integrate it into the TreasureDAO ecosystem.

Why we chosen **Arbitrum** is due to the following reasons:

* **Gas fee cost**: Due to the much lower gas fee cost we can focus on more game based blockchain interaction.
* **Widely adopted L2 blockchain**: L2 systems are gaining traction in recent times and Arbitrum is capable of sustaining high volumes.

## TreasureDAO

The TreasureDAO ecosystem is chosen to host our new Bobot-verse due to the following reasons:

* **Cross pollination of currency and collection:** Multiple projects share the same currency and&#x20;
* **Sharing of community: T**he Arbitrum / treasureDAO community is tightly knitted
* **Selfless Approach to collection launch:** All items in the collection are given out for free and it is up to the community to decide the value of the respective meta-verse. Due to this approach, we will make sure that we make a compelling meta-verse that players will be invest in for the long run.
* **Partnerships with other collections:**  Collaborations with other projects is vital as we help cross promote derivative or new projects
