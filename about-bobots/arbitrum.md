# ðŸš§ Arbitrum

## L1 Project Origin

Bobots is originally designed as an NFT Collection in the Ethereum L1 Blockchain. After seeing the potential in low cost gas fees. It is decided to expand the gameplay aspects of original game and integrate it into the TreasureDAO ecosystem.

Why we chosen **Arbitrum** is due to the following reasons:

* **Gas fee cost**: Due to the much lower gas fee cost we can focus on more game based blockchain interaction.
* **Widely adopted L2 blockchain**: L2 systems are gaining traction in recent times and Arbitrum is capable of sustaining high volumes.
