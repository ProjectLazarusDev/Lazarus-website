# ðŸš§ Arbitrum

## L1 Project Origin

Bobots is originally designed as an NFT Collection in the Ethereum L1 Blockchain. After seeing the potential in low cost gas fees. It is decided to expand the gameplay aspects of original game and integrate it into the TreasureDAO ecosystem.

## **What is Arbitrum**

****[**Arbitrum**](https://arbitrum.io) **** is an Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that allows Ethereum smart contracts to scale by passing messages between the smart contract on the Ethereum main network and those on the Arbitrum second layer chain (L2). Most of the transaction processing is completed on the second layer and thus, drastically improving the speed and efficiency, and also lowering the gas fees.

Why we have chosen **Arbitrum** is due to the following reasons:

* **Lower gas fees**: Due to the much lower gas fee cost, we can focus on more game-based blockchain interaction.
* **Widely adopted L2 blockchain**: L2 systems are gaining traction in recent times and Arbitrum is capable of sustaining high volumes.&#x20;
* **Partnerships**: With multiple DeFi projects that are in the Arbitrum network, we realized that it is critical for us to go into Arbitrum to establish mutually beneficial partnerships
* **Security:** Arbitrum has the right balance between speed and security.

## **How to get started**

Arbitrum has an official tutorial on bridging ETH from the Ethereum Mainnet into Arbitrum. The following link leads to the official tutorial: [https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/](https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/)

To get started, you will require a Web3 wallet such as [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io).&#x20;

Once Metamask has been installed, you will need to add the Arbitrum One network into your wallet.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Arbitrium One (Mainnet)" %}
1. From the Metamask wallet, click on your profile picture, and click on '**Settings**'![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
2. Scroll down and click on '**Networks**'.\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)
3. Click on '**Add Network**' \
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)
4. Use the following details to add Arbitrum One Mainnet to Metamask \
   \
   **Network Name**: Arbitrum One Mainnet \
   **New RPC URL**: [https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc](https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc)\
   **Chain ID**: 42161\
   **Currency Symbol**: ETH\
   **Block Explorer URL**: [https://arbiscan.io/](https://arbiscan.io)
5. Save the following details and Arbitrum One network should be in your Metamask wallet.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Arbitrium One (Testnet)" %}
1. From the Metamask wallet, click on your profile picture, and click on '**Settings**' \
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png>)
2. Scroll down and click on '**Networks**'\
   ![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
3. Click on '**Add Network**'\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)
4. Use the following details to add Arbitrum One Testnet to Metamask \
   \
   Network Name: Arbitrum Testnet \
   New RPC URL: [https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc](https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc)\
   ChainID: 421611\
   Currency Symbol: ETH \
   Block Explorer URL: [https:// testnet.arbiscan.io](https://testnet.arbiscan.io)
5. Save the following details and Arbitrum One Testnet should be in your Metamask wallet.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

After adding the Arbitrum One network into the wallet, it is time to bridge ETH into Arbitrum One. Firstly, head to the Arbitrum One Bridge: [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)

Then, follow the following instructions to successfully bridge ETH:&#x20;

1. Login to your Metamask account and switch to Arbitrum Network. \

2. Enter the amount of ETH that you want to bridge over and click on '**Deposit**'.&#x20;
3. Read the pop-up alert and click on '**Deposit**' again.
4. If you want to withdraw ETH, please read [**Bridging back to Ethereum Mainnet**](arbitrum.md#how-to-get-started-1)**.**
