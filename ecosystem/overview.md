# ðŸŒŽ Overview

## Initial launch

Players who are whitelisted will receive two bobots and one moon base, with the moon base being airdropped at a later timeline.

## Free Mints!

All initial collection launches will be free mints as part of the fair launch ecosystem

## Cross-project consumables

After the launch of Bobots, we will look to explore how we could incorporate established meta-verse consumables into the game. Such resources would be:

* **Legions** - Astronauts visiting the moon
* **Treasure** - Found while mining resources
