# ðŸŒŽ Overview

## Initial launch

Players who are whitelisted will receive two bobots and one moon base, with the moon base being air dropped at a later timeline.

## Free Mints!

All initial collection launches will be free mints as part of the fair launch ecosystem

## Cross-project consumables

After launch of Bobots, we will look to explore how we could incoporate established meta-verse consumables into the game. Such resources would be:

* **Legions** - Astronauts visiting the moon
* **Treasure** - Found while mining resources

## **Multi purpose staking for Bobots**

Player can choose where to stake the Bobots. They can be staked at the following facilities:

* &#x20;[power-training.md](../facilities/power-training.md "mention") - level up your Bobots
* [mining-quest.md](../facilities/mining-quest.md "mention") - send your Bobots for quest
