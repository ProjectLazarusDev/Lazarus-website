# 🏝 Land NFT

Lands are **craftable structures** that can be placed in the Moon Base for Bobots to interact with! Each type of Land provides a unique function for Bobots to collect resources for players, but be careful! These structures will weaken over time as they are used, and may break!&#x20;

Lands can also be bought and sold through the Marketplace to allow players to maximize their gains and growth of their base!&#x20;
