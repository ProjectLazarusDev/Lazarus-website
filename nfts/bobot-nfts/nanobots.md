# Nanobots

These little bots are the legacy models of Bobots. They can be mass-produced, and can do pretty much what a Genesis Bobot can at a lower efficiency. They may get destroyed and lost forever in dangerous situations, so be mindful of that! BBNauts may stumble across nanobots during missions, or earn them through special events.&#x20;
