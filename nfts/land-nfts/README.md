# Land NFTs

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Bobots\_Lands.png)

Lands are **** craftable structures that can be placed in the Moon Base for Bobots to interact with! Each type of Land provides a unique function for Bobots to collect resources, but be careful, as Lands will wear out as they are used and have a chance to break after a period of time!&#x20;

### Tiers

There are currently 3 types of Lands, each with 3 different tiers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Lands are primarily available through the [Crafting Table](../../game-features/moon-base/structures/crafting-table.md) and the Marketplace.&#x20;

Higher tiered Land NFTs provide more returns compared to their lower-tiered counterparts, and are less likely to break. However, higher tiered lands require more Core Points to deploy. Core Points will be returned once the land is removed from the Moon Base.&#x20;
