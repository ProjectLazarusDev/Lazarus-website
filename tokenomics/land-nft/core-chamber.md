# ðŸ”‹ Core Chamber

![Core Chamber on moon base - WIP](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png>)

## Main objective

Use core chamber to level up your bobots!

The tier level of the Bobot will affect how fast the Bobot will take to level up.&#x20;

## Bobot Staking

Staking a bobot will cost 5 $MAGIC. Bobots will return in 24hours with a verdict whether it succeeded or failed.

## Bobot Level to Core Points

Bobots that leveled up will be able to **use more core points** which leads to the player being able to use those points to **build more structures** on the moon base.

| Bobot Level | Core Points |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Level 0     | 100         |
| Level 1     | 150         |
| Level 2     | 200         |
| Level 3     | 250         |
| Level 4     | 300         |
| Level 5     | 350         |
| Level 6     | 400         |
| Level 7     | 450         |
| Level 8     | 500         |
| Level 9     | 550         |
| Level 10    | 600         |

## Staking outcomes

### **Successful**&#x20;

Regain 5 $MAGIC + Core Points (to level up the Bobot to encourage player to buy a better equipment)

### **Failure**

4 $MAGIC to be returned to the player, 1 $MAGIC to be sent to the bank.
