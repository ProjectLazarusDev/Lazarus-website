# Moon Base

_Private cruiser: Code name "Moon Base"._\
_Assessing BBNaut ID..._ \
_ID confirmed._ \
_Welcome home._&#x20;

Most of the gameplay elements in Bobots can be found in the Moon Base. Here, BBNauts can stake their Bobots to collect Core Points and $MAGIC. The resources gained from staking can then be used to craft and build more structures, thus increasing the returns a BBNaut can get over time!

### **Core Points (CP)** <a href="#core-points" id="core-points"></a>

The amount of Core Points a BBNaut has is determined by adding the Core Points of all the Bobots in their possession. Core Points determine how many Lands and Decorations can be placed in the moon base at once. Different structures will cost different amounts of Core Points to be placed, and these Core Points will be returned once a structure is removed from the Moon Base.&#x20;

Core Points can be earned by staking Bobots in the Core Chamber and launching Bobots on missions through the Launch Pad. Each Bobot stores all the Core Points that they have earned individually, and level up as they gain Core Points. Each Bobot also has a maximum amount of Core Points that they can accumulate.&#x20;

If a BBNaut loses possession of a Bobot, they will also lose all the Core Points earned by this Bobot. Structures can no longer be placed down until the total cost of Core Points for all structures in the Moon Base falls below the amount of Core Points the BBNaut currently owns.

### Staking System

BBNauts can stake their Bobots on any of their lands placed in their Moon Base to earn Core Points and $MAGIC. The rates of collecting these resources will differ for the different tiers of Bobots and the Lands they are staked on.

### Crafting System

BBNauts can obtain new Lands by crafting them through the Crafting Table. Each BBNaut owns 1 Crafting Table, and it must be placed in the Moon Base before it can be used.&#x20;

### Leveling System

Bobots level up once they have earned the maximum amount of Core Points for their current level, up to a max level determined by the collection that the Bobot originates from.&#x20;
