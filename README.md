# Bobots

_Earth is lost. Our way of life will never be the same._ \
_We drift in the cold, endless expanse, in the river of stars, in the void of impossibilities._ \
_Our bodies cannot endure the harsh vacuum of space, and had to be preserved in cryostasis._ \
_Our minds are uploaded onto the cloud, the BBNet, as BBNauts._\
_Barely existing, but alive._ \
_In the face of desperation, the frightening tenacity of humankind paved a way to save us all; It gave us hope._ \
_It gave us a chance to rebuild our homes. It gave us… the Bobots._

_You are a BBNaut – uploaded aboard a Monolift Carrier with several others to rebuild your lives._&#x20;

**Build your home in space! explore, collect, and have fun interacting with your Bobots, all on your browser! No minting fee for whitelisted players!**&#x20;

Bobots is a play-to-earn social base-building game on Arbitrium, where players can gather, craft, and customize their very own base in space! Every Bobot you own is 3D and fully animated, ready at your command to dive into the BBNet to start your adventure!&#x20;

The game features a fully customizable base for players to create their dream virtual homes, and leverages on players staking their Bobots on their Lands to earn rewards and progress the game!&#x20;

## **Our Mission**

The Bobots project aims to to allow communities to create their own cities while being able to interact with other people in the community and earn in the process. We believe that metaverse projects should be community-driven, and hope that the team can build various content alongside the community, such as lore, tooling, etc. and receive rewards in $MAGIC while doing so. Above everything else, we want our players to have fun!&#x20;
