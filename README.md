# ðŸ“º Introduction

## What is Bobots?

Bobots is a play-to-earn base building/shooter game on Arbitrium, where players can build Lands in their base, then deploy as their Bobots to fight against the Invasion. Use materials obtained through staking, crafting, and destroying special Mobs during the Invasion to build weapons and decorations of higher rarities! Players can then buy and sell valuable materials, weapons, and Lands to maximize their defenses and earnings!

Bobots are essential to start your journey on the moon. Every player will get a piece of land in their **Moon Base** and a set of Lands to get started**.** Bobots can then be staked in these Lands to earn various resources needed to progress further into the game.&#x20;

## **Our Vision**

The Bobots project aims to to allow communities to create their own cities in **Moon Base** while being able to interact with other people in the community and earn in the process. We believe that metaverse projects should be community-driven, and hope that the team can build various content alongside the community, such as lore, tooling, etc. and receive rewards in $MAGIC while doing so.  Above everything else, we want our players to have fun!&#x20;

## **Player Goals**

The Bobots Universe is made for a large range of players, from those who prefer peaceful social hubs to those who seek high-adrenaline gameplay.

Players who have little time on their hands can focus on building Lands in their Moon Base and staking their Bobots there to level them up and passively earn income.

The more socially inclined can chill and chat with other players in the Central Hub. Discuss about the Moon Base, strategies against the Invasion, or anything at all!&#x20;

Those who seek a challenge can put on their soldier helmets and take to the front lines against the massive horde of the Invasion, which requires skill and quick thinking to maximize their chances at those sweet, sweet material drops.
