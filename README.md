# ðŸ“º Introduction



![Bobots - 3D GameFi Project](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-01 174503.jpg>)

## What is Bobots?

**Bobots is a Play-to-Earn -  GameFi project** on Arbitrium that is built as an entry point into the metaverse. It is a game that integrates commerse and trading between players. Bobots, Equipments represents player characters and items that are used to build, create and extract $MAGIC from the world.&#x20;

Bobots currently utilizes a three-part resource economy:&#x20;

* **$MAGIC**&#x20;
* **Bobots** (NFT | Players)&#x20;
* **Installations** (NFT | Resources)&#x20;

Bobots are essential to start your journey on the moon. They can be staked to earn attributes such as IQ, strength and agility.  For every Bobots user, we will be provided a piece of land in **Moon Base** and a set of beginner installations**.** Bobots will then use these isntallations to mine for $MAGIC to build larger forms of infrastructure and installations.&#x20;

More details will be shared in[ ECOSYSTEM](broken-reference)!

## **Our Vision**

The Bobots project, which are mainly governed by staked $MAGIC holders will be the one overseeing the project. Our goal is to allow communities to create their own cities in **Moon Base** while being able to interact with other people in the community. We believe that metaverse projects should be community-driven,&#x20;

## The Backstory

In the future, humans have discovered vital minerals under the surface of the moon.



## $MAGIC

Integration with $MAGIC is vital in the economy of the Bobot-Verse. We fully intent to use $MAGIC due to the interconnecting eco-system with other projects.
