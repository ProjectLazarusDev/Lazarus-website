# Player Goals

The Bobots Universe is made for casual gameplay interactions and resource management that everyone can be a part of.&#x20;

### Bobot and Earn

\[IMAGE: BASE BUILDING]

The core play-to-earn feature in Bobots can be accessed through the Lands in the Moon Base. Place them down, and stake your Bobots there to allow them to gather valuable resources! Obtain higher quality Lands through crafting or trading with other players to increase the amount of rewards earned, and hoard Core Points to allow more Lands to be placed!&#x20;

### Bobot and Chill

The more socially inclined can chill and chat with other players in the Central Hub. Discuss about the Moon Base, lore, or anything at all!&#x20;

For the artistic minds, the Moon Base offers players with the freedom to customize the placement of pretty much anything, so get those creative juices flowing and show us what you can do!&#x20;

Most of the gameplay will be happening in the Moon Base, and more features will be added on in future updates!&#x20;
