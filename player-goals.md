# Player Goals

The Bobots Universe is made for casual gameplay interactions that everyone can be a part of!&#x20;

### Bobot and Earn

The core play-to-earn feature in Bobots can be accessed through the Lands in the [Moon Base](game-features/moon-base/). Place them down, and stake your Bobots there to allow them to gather valuable resources! Obtain higher quality Lands through crafting or trading with other BBNauts to increase the amount of rewards earned, and hoard Core Points to allow more Lands to be placed!&#x20;

### Bobot and Chill

The more socially inclined can chill and chat with other BBNauts in the [Central Hub](game-features/central-hub.md) and [Black Box](game-features/black-box.md). Discuss about gameplay, lore, or anything at all!&#x20;

For the artistic minds, the Moon Base offers BBNauts with the freedom to customize the placement of pretty much anything, so get those creative juices flowing and show us what you can do!&#x20;
