# Player Goals

\[IMAGE: BASE BUILDING]

The Bobots Universe is made for casual gameplay interactions and simple resource management that everyone can be a part of.&#x20;

Players who have little time on their hands can focus on building Lands in their Moon Base and staking their Bobots there to level them up and passively earn income.&#x20;

The more socially inclined can chill and chat with other players in the Central Hub. Discuss about the Moon Base, strategies to optimize their resource gains, or anything at all!&#x20;
