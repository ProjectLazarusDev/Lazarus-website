# Lands

There are currently 3 types of Lands in the game, each with 3 different tiers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Lands are primarily available through the crafting using the Crafting Table, as well as trading with others in the Marketplace.&#x20;

Higher tiered Land NFTs provide more returns to the player compared to their lower-tiered counterparts, and are less likely to break. However, higher tiered lands require more core points to deploy. Core points will be returned to the player once the land is removed from their Moon Base.

Lands will wear out and have a chance to break after a while, so tread wisely! While new, some Lands may have Break Immunity, so they will not break until the Immunity has been used up.&#x20;
