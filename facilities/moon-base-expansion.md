# ðŸŒ— Moon Base

![Moon Base Prototype](../.gitbook/assets/moonbase.jpg)

To start, there are 3 categories of features that the players are able to use to build their moon base:

* **Foundations**
* **Installations**
* **Decorations**

## **Core Points**

To introduce progression to the building of the moon base, we have incorporated the bobot staking mechanic to allow players to earn core points. These core points will determine how much objects they can place on the moon base. Different objects in the game will have different cost of core points required to place them.

Core points are earned by the bobots being staked, hence the more bobots are being staked the more core points they can use to place more items.

## Foundations

The foundations are "lands" to allow the expansion of the given land that the players are provided with. As each player progresses through the game, more space is needed to expand and increase their earnings throughout the game. This is where foundations come in. Players are able to place more lands on top of each other to expand and increase the number of Drills and Decorative that they can place.

These foundations comes in all shapes and sizes and allows the player to be creative in their designs.

## Installations

### Core chamber&#x20;

Every player will be provided a Power Chamber in order to stake Bobots to earn their attributes. This will be the bobots staking system in the game.&#x20;

### Drill&#x20;

The drills are installments that the players are able to mine Moon Core from. Moon Core is a scarce resource which is represented by $MAGIC. The following are the rates on how the Moon Core is mined:&#x20;

## **Decorations**

Decoratives are aesthetics that allows players to decorate their Moon Base. This allows customization on how each of their lands look. More functionalities on expanding the decorative installations will be announced later.&#x20;
