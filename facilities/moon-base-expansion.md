# ðŸŒ— Moon Base

To start, there are 3 main installations that the players are able to use to build their moon base:

* **Power Chamber**
* **Drill**&#x20;
* **Geometry**

### Power chamber&#x20;

Every player will be provided a Power Chamber in order to stake Bobots to earn their attributes. This will be the staking system in the game. They are able to earn attributes such as Drilling Strength and Drilling Speed.&#x20;

* **Drilling Strength** -  This strength enables the Bobot to increase the amount of Moon Core that they are able to mine from&#x20;
* **Drilling Speed** - The speed enables the Bobot to increase the drilling speed of the drills to increase the amount of Moon Core that they are able to mine from.&#x20;

### Drill&#x20;

The drills are installments that the players are able to mine Moon Core from. Moon Core is a scarce resource which is represented by $MAGIC. The following are the rates on how the Moon Core is mined:&#x20;

### Geometry&#x20;

There are 2 types of geometry: Foundation and Decoratives

#### Foundation

The foundations are "lands" to allow the expansion of the given land that the players are provided with. As each player progresses through the game, more space is needed to expand and increase their earnings throughout the game. This is where foundations come in. Players are able to place more lands on top of each other to expand and increase the number of Drills and Decoratives that they can place.

#### **Decoratives**&#x20;

Decoratives are aesthetics that allows players to decorate their Moon Base. This allows customization on how each of their lands look. More functionalities on expanding the decorative installations will be announced later.&#x20;
